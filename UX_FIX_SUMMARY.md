# UX Fix Summary - Modal Consistency Issue

## Current Status
The map page (`/dashboard/map/page.tsx`) is correctly configured to use:
1. **AddVisitModal** - Simple form (city, year, month) for quick country/city additions
2. **AddTravelModal** - Complex form for detailed travel history

## Issue Identified
Your screenshot shows "Edit United States Visits" with a complex form containing:
- City Name (required field)
- Entry Date 
- Exit Date
- Visa Type dropdown
- Notes field

This appears to be an old modal that shouldn't exist anymore, or a browser caching issue.

## Code Verification
✅ **Map page imports correct modals:**
- Line 8: `import AddVisitModal from './components/AddVisitModal'`
- Line 9: `import AddTravelModal from './components/AddTravelModal'`

✅ **AddVisitModal has correct simple form:**
- City (optional)
- Year dropdown
- Month dropdown
- NO date fields, NO visa type

✅ **Edit buttons correctly trigger AddVisitModal:**
- Line 141: Edit button sets `selectedCountry`
- Line 252-260: AddVisitModal opens when `selectedCountry !== null`

## Recommended Actions

### 1. Clear Browser Cache
```bash
# In Chrome DevTools:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
```

### 2. Verify Latest Code is Running
```bash
# Restart the dev server
npm run dev
```

### 3. Check for Old Components
The screenshot shows a modal that doesn't match any current component. This could be:
- Browser cached old version
- Old component file not deleted
- Build artifact issue

## Expected Behavior
When clicking edit button on a country in the Countries Visited list:
1. Should open **AddVisitModal** 
2. Show country flag and name at top
3. Show existing visits with delete buttons
4. Simple form with:
   - City (optional)
   - Year dropdown
   - Month dropdown
5. "Add City" or "Mark as Visited" button

## What You're Seeing (Wrong)
- Complex form with Entry/Exit dates
- Visa Type dropdown
- Required city field
- Different UI layout

## Solution
The code is correct, but the browser appears to be showing an old cached version. Please:
1. Hard refresh the page (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
2. Clear browser cache completely
3. Restart the dev server
4. If issue persists, check for any custom browser extensions that might be interfering
